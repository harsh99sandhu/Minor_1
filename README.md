PROBLEM STATEMENT

Creating a secure food delivery system in order to protect Customers’ privacy & minimizing the delivery time using our modified algorithm for encryption-decryption and shortest path algorithm.

ABSTRACT

The project aims to bring security in the field of food delivery by creating a mechanism that is capable of encrypting & decrypting customer details and provide shortest path for the delivery. The input take details from the customer for his/her general details which in turn will be encrypted using our modified algorithm. Customer detail will be saved in a file using file handling in the encrypted form only. After successfully creating account, customer can login using the username. At login step, password will be verified with the encrypted password present in the file. Then menu will be displayed for the choice of food. Menu will provide different kind of food options to choose from. At any point of time customer can come back from the menu or continue to explore the menu. Based on the choice of food, specific time will be taken for the preparation. For delivery of food to the customer’s destination, shortest path algorithm will be implemented to deliver it in minimum time possible. At any point of time customer can see the status of the delivery guy and distance left for destination.
